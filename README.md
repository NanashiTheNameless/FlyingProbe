# FlyingProbe

"FlyingProbe" is a personal project of mine designed to replicate those cool SD Card Debuggers.

## Hardware Notes

Inside [The hardware folder](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/FlyingProbe/tree/main/Hardware>) is a large set of renders to describe a design for a probe.

The small (yellow) spring can be a pen spring or something similar.

The probe rod (orange) can be a bent accupuncture needle or paperclip of some kind.

You can also theoretically use a premade probe like this one from [AliExpress](<https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256803993646501.html>).
Although I make no promises of it truly working, it _should_ work, so use at your own risk.

**!!! A Washer should be added in between the bottom spring and the PCB !!!**

## Production

Gerber files can be found [here](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/FlyingProbe/raw/refs/heads/main/production/FlyingProbe.zip>).
